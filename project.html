            <p>As the impracticalities of my original design surfaced, I knew where I had made my error: I had made an assumption of the needs of users based on my own personal thinking and from emulating the competitive landscape rather than using the data I collected. </p>

         <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginning designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
          <p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span>I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered (especially during the visual design). I found myself adding and tweaking features that weren’t of any importance or necessary in any way. In the future, <span>I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
          <p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span>The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts. </span>I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>

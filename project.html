            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
             <p>As an instructor of English as a Second Language (ESL) for over five years, there has been a list of problematic traits common in every school I’ve worked in (across three metropolitan cities and two continents).
               The most egregious is that in an increasingly digital world, pen and paper are still king to the educators, tutors, and students who teach and study English.</p>
               <p><span>Enbox is looking to transport the industry into the 21st century and beyond.</span></p>

          <h2>PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>There is a three-fold problem in the world of adult ESL.</p>
            <p>enter any ESL institution and you will find bookshelves filled with binders filled with syllabi, lesson plans, and tests. This is ineffective, inefficient, and unsustainable.</p>
            <p><span>Second</span>, out of all the cloud-storage services available, neither have an effective organizational system. Files often get lost in the shuffle.<p>
            <p><span>Third</span>, though several products for ESL exist in the market, they are aimed chiefly towards children. Nearly zero products target adult ESL learners and their teachers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>There was universal agreement among all teachers: They waste too much paper. Enbox digitizes tests, assessments, lesson plans, and calendars.</p>
            <p>Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Keeping track of multiple students across multiple classes can be overwhelming for teachers. Enbox's solution is a clean and minimal dashboard with an organizational system based on tags and tasks.</p>
            <p>There is also a need to keep track of student's progress. Is a student ready to move up a level? Enbox lists a set of skills for ESL learners from each level, from beginner to advanced, that serve as a guideline for teachers and objectives for students to advance in their English abilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>PROCESS</h2>
            <h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
              <p>I conducted a SWOT analysis on Google Classroom, Dropbox, and Notion. Two of these services are instantly recognizable, while the third is an up-and-comer making its mark. Though these products offer quality services, an opportunity is open to catering to the world of adult ESL.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <p><span>Google Classroom</span> has a dizzying array of options for educators to enhance their classrooms. However, their scope is too broad, and they don't offer specific servies for ESL instructors.</p>
          <p><span>Dropbox</span>, like Google, has strong name recognition, competitive pricing, ample storage space, and convenient access to other products (like Google Drive). A specific weakness is Dropbox Paper, which is an application that allows users to create original content, but its UX isn't as smooth and intutive.</p>
          <p><span>Notion</span> is a relative newcomer to the market, with trendy UI, clean interactivity, and especially for educators, several templates such as lesson plans. They suffer from some complicated elements, such as its headache-inducing method of important documents from, say, Dropbox. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container survey">
          <h3>User survey</h3>
            <p>User research was focused  on ESL teachers. Nearly every participant of the survey were current or former ESL teachers. From the data, we were able to interpret their wants and needs.
              As a whole, their product choices and behavior were mostly uniform with little deviation. Here were some number that stood out:</p>
              <p><a href="">Click to view the full survey analysis.</a></p>
              <p class="percent">93%</p>
              <p>use Google Drive as their primary cloud service, especially because its ubiquity and compatibility with multiple platforms.</p>
              <p class="percent">65%</p>
              <p>cited “convenience” as the main factor in using their preferred cloud storage service, such as the ability to transfer documents between services. This is the biggest factor as to why nearly all teachers use Google Drive.</p>
              <p class="percent">90%</p>
              <p>wanted a product that allowed for the creation of original content. This included uploading old content as well. The teachers who offered more insight lamented Google Drive's organizational system especially in tandem with Google Docs. Though many teachers used Docs to create content, it was a common issue that documents wouldn't be placed in the right folder, causing a headache when looking for them later on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>
            <p>I interviewed colleagues of mine and I created two user personas. The first was Meg, a disciplined type-A instructor who values efficiency and organization. The second was Nicholas, a level-headed idealist who values simplicity and consistency.
              In my experience from teaching English for nearly a decade, these personality-types were consistent (not to generalize, of course).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container userstories">
          <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p>When I created my user stories, I listed “As a new user, I want to create a new class” as a high-priority item. It was an intuition that wasn't borne out of any of my analysis.
              At the time, it seemed obvious that teachers would expect a classroom setup from a product for their benefit. Though, as I later found out through trouble with the information architecture and user testing, this assumption was leading me astray.</p>
            <p>I would eventually learn of this mistake when I made mockups and did some preliminary testing. </p>
            <p>I went back to the surveys and found that there were two common elements that nearly every user mentioned: <strong>convenience</strong> and <strong>a better system of organization</strong>. I went back to my user stories to reprioritize.</p>
              <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/88471099-c7471580-ced2-11ea-8b06-9c98ef0d4434.png" alt="">
            <p>No longer was “creating a classroom” a high priority, or any priority. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="container userflows">
            <h3>USER FLOWS</h3>
              <p>My userflows also reflected a classroom-centric setup. They all began by choosing a classroom before locating a file.<p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86476982-90d40b80-bd15-11ea-813a-82e0dafcd500.png" alt="">
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86476977-8f0a4800-bd15-11ea-95bf-10bb5e62bf0e.png" alt="">
              <p>The lesson I learned was that <strong>classrooms were secondary</strong>. The user flows going through the classroom were unnecessary. When teachers access a cloud-storage service, they are NOT navigating by classroom. They operate on a "document-first" approach, looking for individual files first.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container wireframes">
              <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
                <p>And what do you know, my wireframes also reflected my "classroom-first" theory. From the dashboard, I initially envisioned choosing a classroom as the first step.</p>
                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86466802-4f863080-bd02-11ea-95ce-f734a32d2f6a.jpg" alt="">

                <p>As the impracticalities of my original design surfaced, I knew where I had made my error: <strong>I had made an assumption of the needs of users based on my own personal thinking and from emulating the competitive landscape rather than using the data I collected.</strong>
                  I went back to my user suvey and interview notes, essentially going back to square one, to see if there was a more practical solution.</p>

      <div class="container mockups">
        <h3>MOCKUPS</h3>
        <p>For the wireframe, I designed a dashboard meant to display the various needs of each teacher from the get-go, including a schedule of upcoming assignments and a to-do list.
          This was the first iteration of what would become the final product. </p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86161609-7ca4ca00-badb-11ea-9396-70b6f7d75de9.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="container prototype">
        <h3>PROTOTYPE + TESTING</h3>
        <p>The high-fidelity mockups went through several rounds of clickable prototypes and preference tests. After the first round, two main issues arose.</p>
        <p>The first was that all the users were overwhelmed by the initial dashboard. It was too busy and users felt overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>The second was that there was no clear hierarchy on the page. The most important aspect of the dashboard was the to-do list, so I attempted to emphasize it by changing the color. This only added to the confusion.</p>
        <p>This wouldn’t do. I went back to the drawing board to create a more prominent to-do list, one that teachers would find both convenient and well-organized.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container visual">
        <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
        <p>Enbox is essentially a filing system for instructors. This, in and of itself, isn’t the most exciting concept. Not only that, but most ESL products are often aimed towards children, replete with bright vibrant colors.
        I wanted to strike a balance between the professionalism of adult education with the youthfulness of a classroom.</p>
        <p>We created a moodboard that would not only reflect a product that is neat and organized, but one that displays a brightness and levity that would light up even the dullest classroom.</p>

                  <h3>LOGO</h3>
                 <p>After some preliminary sketches, I was most drawn to the stack of three boxes. There were several components that aligned with the feel of Enbox.</p>
                 <p>First, was that the stacks emulated a stack of paper or folders. It also formed an "E", perfect for "Enbox". I took that idea and experimented with several iterations.</p>
                 <p>Unfortunately, there was something off about this design. It was just a  little too....square. Then, with the help of a senior editor, a simple edit enhanced the logo.
                 Instead of a stack of boxes atop one another, by flipping the logo by 90 degrees, it suddenly looked like a stack of binders. </p>
                 <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder.  The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

            <h3>FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS</h3>
              <p>When I created my user stories, I listed “As a new user, I want to create a new class” as a high-priority item. It was an intuition that wasn't borne out of any of my analysis.
                At the time, it seemed obvious that teachers would expect a classroom setup from a product for their benefit. Though, as I later found out through trouble with the information architecture and user testing, this assumption was leading me astray.</p>
              <p>Both my user flows and wireframes reflected a classroom-centric setup. My user flows all began by choosing a classroom before locating a file.<p>

            <p><span>Would it be easier to access their files straight from the dashboard?</span></p>
            <p><span>And if it were easier, of what value was organizing the product by classroom?</span></p>
            <p>As the impracticalities of my original design surfaced, I knew where I had made my error: I had made an assumption of the needs of users based on my own personal thinking and from emulating the competitive landscape rather than using the data I collected.
            I went back to my user suvey and interview notes, essentially going back to square one, to see if there was a more practical solution.</p>

                   <p>This wouldn’t do. I went back to the drawing board to create a more prominent to-do list, one that teachers would find both convenient and well-organized.</p>

            <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
              <p>Enbox is essentially a filing system for instructors. This, in and of itself, isn’t the most exciting concept. Not only that, but most ESL products are often aimed towards children, replete with bright vibrant colors.
                I wanted to strike a balance between the professionalism of adult education with the youthfulness of a classroom.</p>
              <p>We created a moodboard that would not only reflect a product that is neat and organized, but one that displays a brightness and levity that would light up even the dullest classroom.</p>

              <p>Enbox is not catered towards those who educate the young, but for those who work with adults. The brand aims to reflect the vivacity and energy that comes from being in a classroom.  This dynamic dichotomy between young and sophisticated, playful and professional, is what Enbox represents.</p>
              <p>This informed our choice of cool, pastel notes as the primary and secondary colors of the brand.</p>

            <h3>LOGO</h3>
           <p>After some preliminary sketches, I was most drawn to the stack of three boxes. There were several components that aligned with the feel of Enbox.</p>
           <p>First, was that the stacks emulated a stack of paper or folders. It also formed an "E", perfect for "Enbox". I took that idea and experimented with several iterations.</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, there was something off about this design. It was just a  little too....square. Then, with the help of a senior editor, a simple edit enhanced the logo.
           Instead of a stack of boxes atop one another, by flipping the logo by 90 degrees, it suddenly looked like a stack of binders. </p>
           <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder.  The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

            <h2>PREFERENCE TESTING</h2>
            <p>For the preference testing, I created several different versions of the dashboard to see what users responded to the most. While making the different iterations, I kept in mind the main issues that came to light during user testing: A busy dashboard with no clear hierarchy.</p>
            <p>The first changes I made were of colors and different icons, thinking that these subtleties would help increase the visibility of the to-do list, which was the most important element on the page.</p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479869-ee1e8b80-bd1a-11ea-8b69-d2e12f2a9cf0.png" alt="">
            <p>Users preferred the simpler icons, but still complained about the business of the page. My next step was to reduce the number of elements on the page.</p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479340-f629fb80-bd19-11ea-88c8-cdb1a99e141d.png" alt="">
            <p>I omitted the "Completed Assignments" section and extended "Student Snapshots" to include more useful stats that would help teachers track student's progress. Now, "Student Snapshots" was taking up the most real estate, taking away from the importance of the to-do list.</p>
            <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479748-c16a7400-bd1a-11ea-8bf1-10c8d949a672.png" alt="">
            <p>This time, I omitted the "Student Snapshot" and altered the to-do list to showcase different actions that were needed by the teacher. Though the teachers I tested preferred the new list by a large margin, they also wondered where the "Student Snapshot" went. More than half also mentioned the variety of colorful elements as being distracting.</p>
            <p>After bumping my head on the table several times to clear my head, I implemented the changes and showcased the newest versions to the teachers. Luckily, they chose this version by a large margin (80%).</p>

             <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
              <p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginning designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
              <p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span>I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered (especially during the visual design). I found myself adding and tweaking features that weren’t of any importance or necessary in any way. In the future, <span>I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
              <p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span>The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts. </span>I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>

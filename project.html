				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>The problem is three-fold</p>
				<p><span>First</span>, ESL instructors continue to use mostly paper. This is unsustainable.</p>
				<p><span>Second</span>, most cloud-storage services lack an effective organizational system for teachers.</p>
				<p><span>Finally</span>, most ESL products are aimed towards children, ignoring the world of adult ESL.</p>

				<h4>Beautifully minimal UI</h4>
				<p>Clean and crisp, Enbox is smooth, intuitive, and materially professional.</p>
				<h4>Digitized testing</h4>
				<p>All tests, including essays, can be made in Enbox and sent directly to students.</p>
				<h4>Student learning objectives</h4>
				<p>A list of level-specific skills guides students to improve and informs teachers for their lesson plans.</p>
				<h4>Automated assessments</h4>
				<p>Grades are automated, analyzed, and recorded for both teachers and students. No red pen necessary.</p>

					<h4>Test #1</h4>
					<p>The first element I tested was the to-do list. I had initially envisioned that icons would represent the task that needed doing, e.g. exclamation point = high-priority item.</p>
					<figure class="userflow"><img alt="Preference testing for tasks" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90970991-72022200-e4d9-11ea-9927-09cd9839dfbf.png"></figure>
				</section>
				<p><span>B was the unanimous winner</span>. The icons were more straight-forward, and organizing by tasks was much more practical than having disparate tasks listed together.</p>
				<section class="paragraph mediumspaceuptop">
					<h4>Test #2</h4>
					<p>The next test was about differentiating between levels.</p>
					<figure class="preferencetesting"><img alt="Preference testing for levels" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90971008-a1b12a00-e4d9-11ea-9b6d-a9c77a83b540.png"></figure>
					<p>In this case, it was a 50/50 split between A and B. <span>I ended up choosing B because of its minimal design</span>, though A would certainly have evinced more levity.</p>

				<h3><i class="fa fa-hourglass-end"></i> Conclusion</h3>
				<p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I wasn't making decisions grounded in data.</p>
				<p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem and the data that I gathered. In the future, <span>I will lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
				<p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span>The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts.</span> I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>

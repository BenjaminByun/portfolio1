					<p>At the time, it seemed obvious that teachers would expect a classroom setup from a product for their benefit. It was an intuition that wasn't borne out of any of my analysis.

						<p>When I tested these low-fi wireframes with teachers, the impracticalities of my original design surfaced.

						<p>I went back to my user suvey and interview notes. From the data, a <strong>"document-first" approach</strong> became more prominent. The following designs kept this in mind.</p>

				 <p>I developed several variations of the dashboard, as you will see in "Prototype and testing".

					<p>The high-fidelity mockups went through several rounds of clickable prototypes and preference tests. After the first round, two main issues arose.</p>
					<p>The first was that all the users were overwhelmed by the initial dashboard. It was too busy and users felt overwhelmed.</p>
					<p>The second was that there was no clear hierarchy on the page. The most important aspect of the dashboard was the to-do list, but it wasn't obvious.</p>
					<p>I went back to create a more prominent to-do list, one that teachers would find both convenient and well-organized.</p>

					 <p>Enbox is essentially a filing system for instructors. This, in and of itself, isn’t the most exciting concept. Not only that, but most ESL products are often aimed towards children, replete with bright vibrant colors. I wanted to strike a balance between the professionalism of adult education with the youthfulness of a classroom.</p>
					 <p>We created a moodboard that would not only reflect a product that is neat and organized, but one that displays a brightness and levity that would light up even the dullest classroom.</p>

					 <p>Enbox is not catered towards those who educate the young, but for those who work with adults. The brand aims to reflect the vivacity and energy that comes from being in a classroom. This dynamic dichotomy between young and sophisticated, playful and professional, is what Enbox represents.</p>
					 <p>This informed our choice of cool, pastel notes as the primary and secondary colors of the brand.</p>

				 </div>
				 <div class="paragraph">
					 <p>After some preliminary sketches, I was most drawn to the stack of three boxes. There were several components that aligned with the feel of Enbox.</p>
					 <p>First, was that the stacks emulated a stack of paper or folders. It also formed an "E", perfect for "Enbox". I took that idea and experimented with several iterations.</p>
					 <p>Unfortunately, there was something off about this design. It was just a little too....square. Then, with the help of a senior editor, a simple edit enhanced the logo. Instead of a stack of boxes atop one another, by flipping the logo by 90 degrees, it suddenly looked like a stack of binders.</p>
					 <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder. The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

				 <p>For the preference testing, I created several different versions of the dashboard to see what users responded to the most. While making the different iterations, I kept in mind the main issues that came to light during user testing: A busy dashboard with no clear hierarchy.</p>
				 <p>The first changes I made were of colors and different icons, thinking that these subtleties would help increase the visibility of the to-do list, which was the most important element on the page.</p>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479869-ee1e8b80-bd1a-11ea-8b69-d2e12f2a9cf0.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>Users preferred the simpler icons, but still complained about the busyness of the page. My next step was to reduce the number of elements on the page.</p>

				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>I omitted the "Completed Assignments" section and extended "Student Snapshots" to include more useful stats that would help teachers track student's progress. Now, "Student Snapshots" was taking up the most real estate, taking away from the importance of the to-do list.</p>

				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>This time, I omitted the "Student Snapshot" and altered the to-do list to showcase different actions that were needed by the teacher. Though the teachers I tested preferred the new list by a large margin, they also wondered where the "Student Snapshot" went. More than half also mentioned the variety of colorful elements as being distracting.</p>
				 </div>
				 <p>After bumping my head on the table several times to clear my head, I implemented the changes and showcased the newest versions to the teachers. Luckily, they chose this version by a large margin (80%).</p>

			 			<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
			 		</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginner designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
						<p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span>I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered. I found myself adding and tweaking features of the visual design that weren’t of any importance or necessary because I was focused on the granular aspects rather than focusing on my . In the future, <span>I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>

           <p>After some preliminary sketches, I was most drawn to the a stack of three boxes. There were several components that aligned with the feel of Enbox.</p>
           <p>First, was that the stacks emulated a stack of paper or folders. It also formed an "E", perfect for "Enbox". I took that idea and experimented with several versions.</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, there was something off about this design. It was too....square. Then, with the help of a senior editor, a simple edit enhanced the logo.</p>
           <p>Instead of a stack of boxes atop one another, by flipping the logo by 90 degrees, it suddenly looked like a stack of binders. </p>
           <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder.  The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

             <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
              <p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginning designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
              <p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span>I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered (especially during the visual design). I found myself adding and tweaking features that weren’t of any importance or necessary in any way. In the future, <span>I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
              <p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span>The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts. </span>I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>

         <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
         <p>Teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) is an industry stuck in amber. In an increasingly digital world, pen and paper are still king to the educators, tutors, and students who teach and study English. Enbox is looking to transport the industry into the 21st century and beyond.</p>

         <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
         <p>Enter any ESL institution and you will find bookshelves filled with binders filled with syllabi, lesson plans, and tests. This is ineffective, inefficient, and unsustainable.</p>
      </section>
      <!-- Solution -->
      <section id="solution">
         <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p> A 5-day scheduler so that the instructor is always aware of upcoming deadlines.</p>
            <p>A To-do list, categorized by tasks such as corrections needed or assignments missing.
            <p>A student snapshot that displays each student’s progress.</p>
            <p>Enbox also comes with a test-making wizard. No printer necessary. Instructors can now create digital tests that can be sent directly to students,who can complete them on a laptop or even their phones.</p>

            <p>I conducted a SWOT analysis on Google Classroom, Dropbox, and Notion. My main finding was that though these products offered quality services,an opportunity was open to catering to the niche world of adult ESL. </p>

         <!-- User survey -->
         <h3>User surveys</h3>
            <p>User research was focused  on ESL teachers. From the data, we were able to interpret their wants and needs.Here were some number that stood out:</p>
            <div class="percent">
               <p><span id="percent">93%</span></p>
               <p>use Google Drive as their primary cloud service</p>
               <p><span id="percent">65%</span></p>
               <p>65% cited “convenience” as the main factor in using their preferred cloud storage service.</p>
               <p><span id="percent">90%</span></p>
               <p>90% wanted a product that allowed uploading and creating original content.</p>
               <p><span id="percent">70%</span></p>
               <p>70% expressed a desire for a product with a better system of tagging and organization</p>
               <a href="project.html" class="button">Survey results</a>
          </div>
         <!-- User personas -->
            <p>From this data, I created two user personas. The first was Meg, a disciplined type-A instructor who values efficiency and organization. The second was Nicholas, a level-headed idealist who values simplicity and consistency.</p>

      <section id="faulty">
         <h2>FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS</h2>
         <p>When I created my user stories, I made an erroneous assumption. I listed “As a new user, I want to create a new class” as a high-priority item. This was borne out of my competitive analysis, but not from the data I collected. </p>
         <!-- <article class="faultyFlows"> -->
            <p>My user flows and wireframes reflected this as well. You can see that my user flows are centered around a product organized around classrooms.</p>
         <!-- </article> -->
         <!-- <article class="faultyFrames"> -->
            <p>In my wireframes, I made classrooms the main element of the dashboard when a teacher created a new account.</p>
         <!-- </article> -->
         <p>Issues began to surface with the clickable prototype:</p>
         <p>Would teachers scour each classroom for specific students or documents?
            Would it be easier to access their files straight from the dashboard?
            Of what value was organizing the product by classroom?
         </p>
         <p>As the impracticalities of my original design surfaced, I knew where I had made my error: I had made an assumption of the needs of users based on my own personal thinking and from emulating the competitive landscape rather than using the data I collected. </p>
      </section>
      <!-- User stories + wireframes -->
      <section>
         <h2>USER STORIES + WIREFRAMES</h2>
         <p>I went back to the surveys and found that there were two common elements that nearly every user mentioned: convenience and a better system of organization. I went back to my user stories to reprioritize. No longer was “creating a classroom” a high priority, or any priority. </p>
            <p>I designed a dashboard meant to display the various needs of each teacher from the get-go, including a schedule of upcoming assignments and a to-do list.</p>
      </section>
      <!-- Visual design -->
      <section>
         <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
          <p>Enbox is essentially a filing system for instructors. This, in and of itself, isn’t the most exciting concept. As such,</p>
          <p>We created a moodboard that would not only reflect a product that is neat and organized, but one that displays a brightness and levity that would light up even the dullest classroom.</p>
         <!-- Color -->
         <article class="color">
            <h3>Color</h3>
              <p>Enbox is not catered towards those who educate the young, but for those who work with adults. The brand aims to reflect the vivacity and energy that comes from being in a classroom.  This dynamic dichotomy between young and sophisticated, playful and professional, is what Enbox represents.</p>
              <p>This informed our choice of cool, pastel notes as the primary and secondary colors of the brand.</p>
         </article>
         <!-- Logo -->
         <article class="logo">
            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder.  The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

      <!-- Prototype and testing -->
      <section>
         <h2>PROTOTYPE + TESTING</h2>
         <p>The high-fidelity mockups went through several rounds of clickable prototypes and preference tests. After the first round, two main issues arose.</p>
         <!-- Mockup -->
         <!-- <article class="mockup1"> -->
            <p>The first was that all the users were overwhelmed by the initial dashboard. The second was that there was no clear hierarchy on the page</p>
         <!-- </article> -->
         <p>This wouldn’t do. I went back to the drawing board to create a more prominent to-do list, one that teachers would find both convenient and well-organized.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
         <p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginning designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
         <p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span class="conclusion">I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered (especially during the visual design). I found myself adding and tweaking features that weren’t of any importance or necessary in any way. In the future, <span class="conclusion">I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
         <p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span class="conclusion">The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts. </span>I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>

          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>An<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality"> adventurer </a> at heart, I'm a passionate, thoughtful, and curious designer. My biggest strength is my <span>deep sense of empathy.</span></p>
          <p>Empathy was a part of my upbringing. As a middle-child, I was a natural mediator who always looked for solutions that addressed everyone's issues. This has helped me in my career in film and television production, where we were always solving logistical problems with practical solutions. This also involved catering to the whims of the talent, a full-time job in and of itself (one well-known actor demanded to be given a bottle of water in a highly specific manner, else he'd toss the bottle across the room).</p>
          <p>As the son of immigrant parents, I always felt like an outsider looking in. As a first-generation American with Korean ethnicity, I never quite fit in as an American. As a Korean-American, I never fit belonged with Korean nationals (nor could I, as an adult, keep up with their drinking). This constant feeling of being on the outside created a passion for keeping people on the inside. I want users to belong. This has helped in my career as a teacher of English as a second language. I understood the excitement of living in another country, the challenges of learning a new language, and the fear of failure and judgement in acclimating to a different culture. These insights informed me when creating lesson plans for my students, who varied from overworked 5-year-olds from South Korea to 60-year-old heart surgeons from Belarus.</p>
        <p><span>I've always been able to understand the experiences and point-of-view of others; this drives my UX philosophy of user-centered design.</span></p>

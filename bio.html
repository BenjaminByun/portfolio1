        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>An<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality"> adventurer </a> at heart, I am a minimalist with a dedication to developing intuitive experiences that users can easily understand. My biggest strength as a UX designer is my <span>deep sense of empathy.</span></p>
        <p>Empathy was a part of my upbringing. As a middle-child, I was a natural mediator who always looked for solutions that addressed everyone's issues. This has helped me in my career in film and television production, where we were always solving logistical problems with practical solutions. This also involved catering to the whims of the talent, a full-time job in and of itself (one well-known actor demanded to be given a bottle of water in a highly specific manner, else he'd toss the bottle across the room).</p>
          <p>As the son of immigrant parents, I always felt like an outsider looking in. As a first-generation American with Korean ethnicity, I never quite fit in as an American. As a Korean-American, I never fit belonged with Korean nationals (nor could I, as an adult, keep up with their drinking). This constant feeling of being on the outside created a passion for keeping people on the inside. I want users to belong. This has helped in my career as a teacher of English as a second language. I understood the excitement of living in another country, the challenges of learning a new language, and the fear of failure and judgement in acclimating to a different culture. These insights informed me when creating lesson plans for my students, who varied from overworked 5-year-olds from South Korea to 60-year-old heart surgeons from Belarus.</p>
            <p><span>I've always been able to understand the experiences and point-of-view of others; this drives my UX philosophy of user-centered design.</span></p>
          <!-- <h4>What introduced you to design?</h4>
           <p>Comic strips were my first introduction to design. I was an avid comic reader and collector, from the Far Side to Ziggy the Pinhead. I grabbed the paper each morning to flip straight to the daily strips.</p>
           <p>Sundays were like Christmas morning. The usual monochrome drabness of the weekday strips were transformed into grander visions, with splashes of color and more panels to tell a story. </p>
           <p>Bill Watterson, creator of Calvin and Hobbes, was my hero. Watterson was able to convince editors to give him more creative control his Sunday layouts. The results were incredible. I remember vividly Calvin and Hobbes enveloping half a page. His comics were a masterclass in visual design in the context of storytelling. Inspired, I spent countless hours creating layouts for my own comics with my own characters.</p>
          <h4>Why is design important to you?</h4>
          <p>I learned the importance of design through my family.</p>
          <p>I grew up with an engineer-minded father and an artistically-inclined mother. Math and science were just as encouraged as the arts, AP Calc and Bio in tandem with orchestra and string quartet. I would consult my father for more precise, scientific endeavors, such as setting up a lab experiment that tested whether antibiotic soaps were more or less effective than their counterparts. Then I’d pair up with my mother to create a three-paneled display to illustrate the steps taken, conclusions reached, and the lessons learned from these experiments (for those curious, antibacterial soaps were more effective initially, but less so upon each subsequent use).</p>
          <p>If there’s one lesson I learned from this dichotomy, it’s that an idea is only as good as its presentation. Despite the complicated nature of my experiment, it only mattered to the judges that I was able to present my findings in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner (I placed third).</p>
          <p>A revolutionary idea with the power to change the world will putter out if it doesn't grab anyone’s attention. The look and feel of an idea, and how a user interacts and understands it, makes all the difference.</p> -->

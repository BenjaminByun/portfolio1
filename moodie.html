			<h4>USER FLOWS</h4>
			<p><span>The most challenging aspect of the flow was figuring out how to get users to input their ingredients.</span></p>
			<p>This process is burdensome and time-consuming, two killers of user interest. Originally, I had incorporated this step as part of the onboarding process.</p>

			</figure>
			<div class="paragraph">
			<p>In this flow, the red path represents inputting ingredients. Users had the option of skipping it altogether.</p>
			<p>If the user chooses to go through the onboarding process, it's evident that there's no quick and easy way to get through this. As I would learn, <span>this task was much too daunting</span>, even if optional, as part of an onboarding process.</p>
			<p>The new flow would eventually get rid of this linear progression of adding ingredients, and put it all into one screen.</p>

				<h3 id="wireframing"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> WIREFRAMING</h3>
				<p>I fleshed out the process of inputting ingredients into wireframes.

		<div class="paragraph bold">
			<p><span>Another challenge was how to incorporate two high-level but distinct actions</span>. Adding ingredients and filtering the recipes were equally important. But how to incorporate it without clutter? All the recipe apps I’ve browsed felt too busy and claustrophobic. This may have been okay for their purposes, but I wanted my app to be as simple and clean as possible.</p>
			<img class="mediumimage" alt="Moodie Mood button sketch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90394994-b026be00-e061-11ea-8b47-8a5dfe2707ff.png"><img alt=" Moodie Mood button wireframe" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745388-8843c300-da81-11ea-941d-fcc61082a438.png">
			<p>My original solution was to incorporate a floating action button, or FAB for short. In my original wireframes, I experimented with the design of using a FAB. As you will see in my mockups, I took this idea a step further.</p>
		</div>
		<section class="paragraph spaceuptop">
			<h4>MOCKUPS</h4>
			<p>Though there were a few apps that factored in ingredients into finding recipes, they were not well known. <span>I wanted to set Moodie ahead of the pack.</span></p>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>I was still determined to make the onboarding process work. I hypothesized that by making the onboarding process into a type of whack-a-mole game in which users just touch the ingredients they have, the process would be more enjoyable.</p>

			<figure class="fullimage"><img alt="Moodie Mood button mockup" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90568439-d50e5480-e179-11ea-9664-6e861cd77d40.png"></figure>
		<div class="paragraph bold">
			<p>The idea of a floating action "MOOD" button was not only useful, but unique. I was feeling bold and decided to incorporate two FABs: the aforementinoed MOOD button and a simpler ADD button to input ingredients. Both were of equal importance but completely separate.</p>
		</div>
		<section class="paragraph spaceuptop bold">
				<h3 id="testing"><i class="fa fa-flask"></i> TESTING</h3>
				<p>I tested the prototype with several participants. The two solutions I came up with in my high-fidelity mockups, the onboarding process and the FAB buttons, both ran into problems.</p>

				<h4>ONBOARDING TROUBLES</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Upon testing, the onboarding process had a success rate of 0%. Yep. There were several issues.</p>
				<div class="mediumspaceuptop">
					<p><span>First was the suddenness of this daunting task.</span> As the first step after signing in, there was a bit too much to do without a proper introduction to the app.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mediumspaceuptop">
					<p><span>Next was the lack of progression.</span> Because inputting ingredients wasn’t meant to be a clearly linear process. As a result, users were confused with what to do after inputting ingredients. Though there were breadcrumbs in the original wireframes, those have since been omitted because of their perceived lack of importance.</p>
				<div class="mediumspaceuptop">
					<p><span>I had to omit this process from the onboarding.</span> But then when would users input their ingredients? Most of the app’s value comes from its ability to give results based on what’s already in the user's kitchens.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
		</section>
			<figure class="fullimage"><img alt="Moodie information onboarding mockup" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90568510-07b84d00-e17a-11ea-8f61-ffd368c1c1f0.png"></figure>
			<div class="paragraph bold">
				<p>The solution was to offer only <span>an informational onboarding</span> that lets users know the importance of inputting ingredients. Then on the dashboard, have a salient call-to-action so users can easily input ingredients at any point.</p><img alt="Moodie kitchen mockup" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90568596-33d3ce00-e17a-11ea-8f1a-1fdd82b4b5e6.png">
				<p>The input wizard was also omitted to create a list of broad categories that most ingredients fall under. Users can access them by simply clicking on the category, and then they’d be able to touch each ingredient to add it, and touch it again to delete it. <span>Success rate went from 0 to 100.</span></p>
				<section class="spaceuptop">
					<h4>MOOD SWINGS</h4>
					<p>The mood button was confusing and unintuitive to users.</p>
					<p>It wasn't exactly clear what the mood button did and how it worked. And though 40% of participants enjoyed the look and feel of it, most did not care much for it.</p>
					<figure class="smallpic"><img alt="Moodie filter button mockup" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90568663-59f96e00-e17a-11ea-99b7-abe437a154ca.png"></figure>
					<p>The solution? <span>A filter button.</span> It is an intuitive icon, one that is common and is usually located in the top-right corner. Though it no longer had the flash of a mood button, it was simple, practical, and easily understood by 100% of participants.</p>

				<h2>PREFERENCE TESTING</h2>
				<p>The first preference test I performed had to do with the images of food. The images of the food is just as important as the food itself, according to several of survey participants. I wanted to test how big users liked their images.</p>

				<p>Within these choices, B was the clear winner. It provided bigger pictures on cards that showed more relevant information. Details were also much easier to read.</p>

			<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
			<p>I learned two important lessons from this product.</p>
			<p>The first was this: <span>Don't expect the user to do any heavy lifting right away</span>. Even the most enthuastic of users will lose interest real quick. To put it another way...it's a total mood-killer.</p>
			<p>The second lesson is one that's easily forgotten in the midst of ideating: <span>Be practical</span>. I wanted Moodie to stand out from the competition. A floating action MOOD button seemed like a perfect idea. I cherised the idea like Gollum and his ring, so it was a rude awakening when most users couldn't make sense of it. I had a choice: I could hold onto the idea as it fell into the depths of Mordor...or I could come up with a sensible solution.</p>
			<p>A filter button was the sensible solution. No pizzazz, maybe even pedestrian, but it worked.</p>
			<p>Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. Yet.</p>

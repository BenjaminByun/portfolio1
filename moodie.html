		<div class="paragraph">
      <p>What you cook is limited by two major factors: <span>what you want</span> and <span>what you have.</span></p>
      <p>First, <span>the want.</span> Whenever you crave something, there are myriad methods of finding recipes: social media, blogs, vlogs, DuckDuckGo, apps, and more. Which to choose from? Who to trust?</p>
      <p>Next, <span>the have</span>s. Not only do you have the paralysis of choice, but the results you receive aren’t always practical, with recipes calling for ingredients you never even heard of. FenuGreek leaves? Aceto balsamico tradizionale? Quinoa? Finding the perfect recipe is as random as betting on double 0 in roulette.</p>

			 <div class="paragraph bold">

					 	<p>If the user chooses to go through the onboarding process, it's evident that there's no quick and easy way to get through this. As I would learn, <span>this task was much too daunting</span>, even if optional, as part of an onboarding process.</p>

						<p><span>Another challenge was how to incorporate two high-level but distinct actions</span></p><p>Adding ingredients and filtering the recipes were equally important. But how to incorporate it without clutter? All the recipe apps I’ve browsed felt too busy and claustrophobic. This may have been okay for their purposes, but I wanted my app to be as simple and clean as possible.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/90394994-b026be00-e061-11ea-8b47-8a5dfe2707ff.png" alt="">

						<p>My original solution was to incorporate a <span>floating action button</span>, or <span>FAB</span> for short. In my original wireframes, I experimented with the design of using a FAB. As you will see in my mockups, I took this idea a step further.</p>

				 </div>
				 <div class="paragraph">
					 <p>I was still determined to make the onboarding process work. I hypothesized that by making the onboarding process into a type of whack-a-mole game in which users just touch the ingredients they have, the process would be more enjoyable.</p>

				 <div class="paragraph bold">
				 <p>I decided to take this idea of an FAB and incorporate two onto the dashboard. The idea of a "MOOD" button was not only useful, but unique.

Both were of equal importance but completely separate.</P>

					<h3>PROTOTYPE + TESTING</h3>

				<div class="paragraph bold">
					<p>I tested the prototype with several participants. The two solutions I came up with in my high-fidelity mockups both ran into problems.</p>
					<div class="link blacklink">

					</div>
					<div class="spaceuptop">
						<h5>ONBOARDING TROUBLES</h5>
					</div>
						<p>Upon testing, the onboarding process had a success rate of 0%. Yep. There were several issues.</p>
						<div class="smallspaceuptop">
							<p><span>First was the suddenness of this daunting task.</span></p><p>As the first step after signing in, there was a bit too much to do without a proper introduction to the app.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="smallspaceuptop">
							<p><span>Next was the lack of progression.</span></p><p>Because inputting ingredients wasn’t meant to be a clearly linear process. As a result, users were confused with what to do after inputting ingredients. Though there were breadcrumbs in the original wireframes, those have since been omitted because of their perceived lack of importance.</p>
						</div>
						<p><span>I had to omit this process from the onboarding.</span> But then when would users input their ingredients? Most of the app’s value comes from its ability to give results based on what’s already in the user's kitchens.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="smallimage">
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89816021-c7baef80-db13-11ea-9174-17c49ac16172.png" alt="">
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph bold">
						<p>The solution was to offer only <span>an informational onboarding</span> that lets users know the importance of inputting ingredients. Then on the dashboard, have a salient call-to-action so users can easily input ingredients at any point.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89817933-ef5f8700-db16-11ea-83b7-a27ccae178a9.png" alt="">
						<p>The input wizard was also omitted to create a list of broad categories that most ingredients fall under. Users can access them by simply clicking on the category, and then they’d be able to touch each ingredient to add it, and touch it again to delete it. <span>Success rate went from 0 to 100.</span></p>
				</div>
				<div class="smallspaceuptop paragraph bold">
					<h5>MOOD SWINGS</h5>
					<p><span>The mood button was confusing and unintuitive to users.</span></p>
					<p>It wasn't exactly clear what the mood button did and how it worked. And though 40% of participants enjoyed the look and feel of it, most did not care much for it.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
					<div class="paragraph lessspaceuptop bold">
						<p>The solution? <span>A filter button.</span> It is an intuitive icon, one that is common and is usually located in the top-right corner. Though it no longer had the flash of a mood button, it was simple, practical, and easily understood by 100% of participants.</p>

					 <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
				 </div>
				 <div class="paragraph bold">
					 <p>When I first designed the app, <span>I was excited about a design feature that would stand out amongst other apps</span>: the <span>MOOD</span> button. I had seen the floating action button be put to good use in complicated apps such as My Fitness Pal, to much success. FABs are clear, salient, and offer a high-end function without cramping up the UX of the rest of the app.</p>
					 <p><span>The problem was that it wasn’t practical.</span> When users clicked on the mood button, a list of options would show up such as “cuisine” or “cooking time”. Once they chose one, the user would be taken to a screen where they could choose one or more from a list of options in order to narrow down their results.</p>
					 <p>But surely, users would want to input more than one filter at any given moment. What if they wanted a meal within 15 minutes that also happened to be Korean? From how the initial user flow developed, this would create an extra step that made the Mood button obsolete. Realizing that it was just an advanced filter option, I opted to make it a simple filter function. <span>Though it didn’t have the flash or appeal of a FAB, it was simple and intuitive that all the users understood. right away.</span>
						<p>My biggest takeaway from this was this: Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. Yet.</p>

		<div class="paragraph">
      <p>What you cook is limited by two major factors: <span>what you want</span> and <span>what you have.</span></p>
      <p>First, <span>the want.</span> Whenever you crave something, there are myriad methods of finding recipes: social media, blogs, vlogs, DuckDuckGo, apps, and more. Which to choose from? Who to trust?</p>
      <p>Next, <span>the have</span>s. Not only do you have the paralysis of choice, but the results you receive aren’t always practical, with recipes calling for ingredients you never even heard of. FenuGreek leaves? Aceto balsamico tradizionale? Quinoa? Finding the perfect recipe is as random as betting on double 0 in roulette.</p>

			 	<h3>USER FLOWS</h3>
			 </div>
			 <div class="paragraph">
				 <p>The most challenging aspect of the flow was figuring out how to get users to input their ingredients. This process is burdensome and time-consuming, two killers of user interest. Originally, I had incorporated this step as part of the onboarding process. As I would find out later in testing, this being a first step was the wrong step.</p>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745002-afe55c00-da7e-11ea-9c0f-153c97b5f849.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
				 	<p>In this flow, you can see that the user has the chance to skip the onboarding wizard altogether to go straight to the dashboard.</p>

					 </div>
					 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 	<p>If the user chooses to go through the onboarding process, it's evident that there's no quick and easy way to get through this. As I would learn, this task is much too daunting to put, even if optional, as part of an onboarding process.</p>
						<p>The new flow would eventually get rid of this linear progression of adding ingredients, and put it all into one screen.</p>
					 </div>
				 </div>
			 <div class="heading spaceuptop">
			 		<h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
			 </div>
			 <div class="paragraph">
				 	<p>In my previous project, the big lesson I learned was to set a strong foundation before considering the visual design. I did this beginning with the wireframes, where I carefully followed the tenets of material design before any visual input. This has helped the progression of my project by miles.</p>

					</div>
						<p>The original onboarding process was daunting to say the least.</p>
						<p>Another challenge was how to incorporate two high-level but distinct actions, adding ingredients and filtering the recipes, onto the dashboard without too much clutter.  All the recipe apps I’ve browsed felt claustrophobic and cluttered. This may have been okay for their purposes, but I wanted my app to be as simple and clean as possible.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745388-8843c300-da81-11ea-941d-fcc61082a438.png" alt="">
						<p>My original solution was to incorporate a floating action button, or FAB for short. In my original wireframes, I experimented with the design of using a FAB. As you will see in my mockups, I took this idea a step further.</p>

			 <div class="heading spaceuptop">
				 <h3>MOCKUPS</h3>

				 <p>I wanted Moodie to stand out from the competition. Though there were a few apps that factored in ingredients into finding recipes, they were not well known. I wanted to find a way to set Moodie ahead of the pack.</p>

					 <p>I was still determined to make the onboarding process work. I hypothesized that by making the onboarding process into a type of whack-a-mole game in which users just touch the ingredients they have.</p>
				 </div>
				 <p></p>
				 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745779-07d29180-da84-11ea-9365-3ed6499cd9a7.png" alt="">
				 <p>I decided to take this idea of an FAB and incorporate two onto the dashboard. The idea of a "MOOD" button was not only useful, but unique. Moodie would stand out from its rivals with its signature "MOOD" button! I was feeling bold and decided to incorporate two FABs: the aforementinoed "MOOD" button and a simpler "add" button to input ingredients. Both were of equal importance but completely separate. I thought two FABs were the perfect solution.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="heading spaceuptop">
					<h3>PROTOTYPE + TESTING</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>I tested the prototype with several participants. The two solutions I came up with in my high-fidelity mockups both ran into problems.</p>
					<div class="mediumspaceuptop">
						<h5>ONBOARDING TROUBLES</h5>
					</div>
						<p>Upon testing, the onboarding process had a success rate of 0%. Yep. There were several issues.</p>
						<p>First was the suddenness of this daunting task. As the first step after signing in, there was a bit too much to do without a proper introduction to the app.</p>
						<p>Next was the lack of progression. Because inputting ingredients wasn’t meant to be a clearly linear process. As a result, users were confused with what to do after inputting ingredients. Though there were breadcrumbs in the original wireframes, those have since been omitted because of their perceived lack of importance.</p>
						<p>There was no way around it. <span>I had to omit this process from the onboarding.</span> But then when would users input their ingredients? Most of the app’s value comes from its ability to give results based on what’s already in the user's kitchens.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89816021-c7baef80-db13-11ea-9174-17c49ac16172.png" alt="">
						<p>The solution was to offer only an informational onboarding that lets users know the importance of inputting ingredients. Then on the dashboard, have a salient call-to-action so users can easily input ingredients at any point.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89817933-ef5f8700-db16-11ea-83b7-a27ccae178a9.png" alt="">
						<p>The input wizard was also omitted to create a list of broad categories that most ingredients fall under. Users can access them by simply clicking on the category, and then they’d be able to touch each ingredient to add it, and touch it again to delete it. Success rate went from 0 to 100.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="smallspaceuptop paragraph">
					<h5>MOOD SWINGS</h5>
					<p>The mood button also ran into some issues.</p>
					<p>It wasn't exactly clear what the mood button did and how it worked. And though 40% of participants enjoyed the look and feel of it, most did not care much for it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<div class="smallpic lessspaceuptop">
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89817490-3600b180-db16-11ea-88b1-3d47217cefb2.png" alt="">
					</div>
				</div>
					<div class="paragraph lessspaceuptop">
						<p>The solution? A filter button. It is an intuitive icon, one that is common and is usually located in the top-right corner. Though it no longer had the flash of a mood button, it was simple, practical, and easily understood by 100% of participants.</p>

					 <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
				 </div>
				 <div class="paragraph">
					 <p>When I first designed the app, I was excited about a design feature that would stand out amongst other apps: the “Mood” button. I had seen the floating action button be put to good use in complicated apps such as My Fitness Pal, to much success. FABs are clear, salient, and offer a high-end function without cramping up the UX of the rest of the app.</p>
					 <p>The problem was that it wasn’t practical from a user flow perspective. When users clicked on the mood button, a list of options would show up such as “cuisine” or “cooking time”. Once they chose one, the user would be taken to a screen where they could choose one or more from a list of options in order to narrow down their results.</p>
					 <p>But surely, users would want to input more than one filter at any given moment. What if they wanted a meal within 15 minutes that also happened to be Korean? From how the initial user flow developed, this would create an extra step that made the Mood button obsolete. Realizing that it was just an advanced filter option, I opted to make it a simple filter function. Though it didn’t have the flash or appeal of a FAB, it was simple and intuitive that all the users understood right away. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel….yet.</p>

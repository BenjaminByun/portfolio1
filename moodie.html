		<div class="paragraph">
      <p>What you cook is limited by two major factors: <span>what you want</span> and <span>what you have.</span></p>
      <p>First, <span>the want.</span> Whenever you crave something, there are myriad methods of finding recipes: social media, blogs, vlogs, DuckDuckGo, apps, and more. Which to choose from? Who to trust?</p>
      <p>Next, <span>the have</span>s. Not only do you have the paralysis of choice, but the results you receive aren’t always practical, with recipes calling for ingredients you never even heard of. FenuGreek leaves? Aceto balsamico tradizionale? Quinoa? Finding the perfect recipe is as random as betting on double 0 in roulette.</p>

			 	<h3>USER FLOWS</h3>
			 </div>
			 <div class="paragraph">
				 <p>The most challenging aspect of the flow was figuring out how to get users to input their ingredients. This process is burdensome and time-consuming, two killers of user interest. Originally, I had incorporated this step as part of the onboarding process. As I would find out later in testing, this being a first step was the wrong step.</p>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745002-afe55c00-da7e-11ea-9c0f-153c97b5f849.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
				 	<p>In this flow, you can see that the user has the chance to skip the onboarding wizard altogether to go straight to the dashboard.</p>

						 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89744799-6ac12a00-da7e-11ea-9555-96d85e83b1ab.png">
					 </div>
					 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 	<p>If the user chooses to go through the onboarding process, it's evident that there's no quick and easy way to get through this. As I would learn, this task is much too daunting to put, even if optional, as part of an onboarding process.</p>
						<p>The new flow would eventually get rid of this linear progression of adding ingredients, and put it all into one screen.</p>
					 </div>
				 </div>
			 <div class="heading spaceuptop">
			 		<h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
			 </div>
			 <div class="paragraph">
				 	<p>In my previous project, the big lesson I learned was to set a strong foundation before considering the visual design. I did this beginning with the wireframes, where I carefully followed the tenets of material design before any visual input. This has helped the progression of my project by miles.</p>

					</div>
						<p>The original onboarding process was daunting to say the least.</p>
						<p>Another challenge was how to incorporate two high-level but distinct actions, adding ingredients and filtering the recipes, onto the dashboard without too much clutter.  All the recipe apps I’ve browsed felt claustrophobic and cluttered. This may have been okay for their purposes, but I wanted my app to be as simple and clean as possible.</p>
						<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745388-8843c300-da81-11ea-941d-fcc61082a438.png" alt="">
						<p>My original solution was to incorporate a floating action button, or FAB for short. In my original wireframes, I experimented with the design of using a FAB. As you will see in my mockups, I took this idea a step further.</p>
			 </div>
			 <div class="heading spaceuptop">
				 <h3>MOCKUPS</h3>
			 </div>
			  <div class="paragraph">
				 <p>For the first round of mockups, I decided to take this idea of a FAB and incorporate two onto the dashboard. The idea of a "MOOD" button was not only useful, but unique. Moodie would stand out from its rivals with its signature "MOOD" button!</p>

					 <p>I was still determined to make the onboarding process work. I hypothesized that by making the onboarding process into a type of whack-a-mole game in which users just touch the ingredients they have.</p>
				 </div>
				 <p></p>
				 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/89745779-07d29180-da84-11ea-9365-3ed6499cd9a7.png" alt="">
				 <p>In regards to putting to high-level actions on the dashboard, I was feeling bold and decided to incorporate two FABs: the aforementinoed "MOOD" button and a simpler "add" button to input ingredients.</p>

				<!-- <div class="heading spaceuptop">
					<h3>PROTOTYPE + TESTING</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>The high-fidelity mockups went through several rounds of clickable prototypes and preference tests. After the first round, two main issues arose.</p>
					<p>The first was that all the users were overwhelmed by the initial dashboard. It was too busy and users felt overwhelmed.</p>
					<p>The second was that there was no clear hierarchy on the page. The most important aspect of the dashboard was the to-do list, but it wasn't obvious.</p>
					<p>I went back to create a more prominent to-do list, one that teachers would find both convenient and well-organized.</p>

					 <p>Enbox is essentially a filing system for instructors. This, in and of itself, isn’t the most exciting concept. Not only that, but most ESL products are often aimed towards children, replete with bright vibrant colors. I wanted to strike a balance between the professionalism of adult education with the youthfulness of a classroom.</p>
					 <p>We created a moodboard that would not only reflect a product that is neat and organized, but one that displays a brightness and levity that would light up even the dullest classroom.</p>

				 	<h3>LOGO</h3>
				 </div>
				 <div class="paragraph">
					 <p>After some preliminary sketches, I was most drawn to the stack of three boxes. There were several components that aligned with the feel of Enbox.</p>
					 <div class="mediumpic">
						 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/88495668-a3dea200-cf88-11ea-90e6-99963efbde92.png">
					 </div>
					 <p>First, was that the stacks emulated a stack of paper or folders. It also formed an "E", perfect for "Enbox". I took that idea and experimented with several iterations.</p>
					 <div class="mediumpic">
						 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/88495891-5dd60e00-cf89-11ea-84b8-966aea046a22.png">
					 </div>
					 <p>Unfortunately, there was something off about this design. It was just a little too....square. Then, with the help of a senior editor, a simple edit enhanced the logo. Instead of a stack of boxes atop one another, by flipping the logo by 90 degrees, it suddenly looked like a stack of binders.</p>
					 <p>This product promises to keep all of a teacher’s curriculum, lesson plans, quizzes, and grades in neat and pristine order in the cloud. No waste, less clutter, always accessible. It will be as if all their virtual papers are stashed away properly in its correct corresponding color-coded binder. The logo is representative of these virtual binders.</p>

			 	<h3>PREFERENCE TESTING</h3>
			 </div>
			 <div class="paragraph preferencetesting">
				 <p>For the preference testing, I created several different versions of the dashboard to see what users responded to the most. While making the different iterations, I kept in mind the main issues that came to light during user testing: A busy dashboard with no clear hierarchy.</p>
				 <p>The first changes I made were of colors and different icons, thinking that these subtleties would help increase the visibility of the to-do list, which was the most important element on the page.</p>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479869-ee1e8b80-bd1a-11ea-8b69-d2e12f2a9cf0.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>Users preferred the simpler icons, but still complained about the busyness of the page. My next step was to reduce the number of elements on the page.</p>
				 </div>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479340-f629fb80-bd19-11ea-88c8-cdb1a99e141d.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>I omitted the "Completed Assignments" section and extended "Student Snapshots" to include more useful stats that would help teachers track student's progress. Now, "Student Snapshots" was taking up the most real estate, taking away from the importance of the to-do list.</p>
				 </div>
				 <div class="smallpic">
					 <img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52806406/86479748-c16a7400-bd1a-11ea-8bf1-10c8d949a672.png">
				 </div>
				 <div class="lessspaceuptop">
					 <p>This time, I omitted the "Student Snapshot" and altered the to-do list to showcase different actions that were needed by the teacher. Though the teachers I tested preferred the new list by a large margin, they also wondered where the "Student Snapshot" went. More than half also mentioned the variety of colorful elements as being distracting.</p>
				 </div>
				 <p>After bumping my head on the table several times to clear my head, I implemented the changes and showcased the newest versions to the teachers. Luckily, they chose this version by a large margin (80%).</p>

			 			<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
			 		</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						<p>The most important lesson I learned from this project was one of flawed assumptions. By ignoring the data and emulating products already in the market, I was setting myself up for failure. As a beginner designer, I have read and been told that imitation is commonplace and an accepted part of the industry. It seems that I have to find the right balance between emulating the useful elements of others and also making my own.</p>
						<p>This lesson also ties into the scope and purpose of the product. <span>I’ve found that I lost sight of the original problem</span> and the data that I gathered. I found myself adding and tweaking features of the visual design that weren’t of any importance or necessary because I was focused on the granular aspects rather than focusing on my . In the future, <span>I will have to make sure I lay a solid foundation and stick to the fundamentals</span> before I let my imagination steer me off-course.</p>
						<p>For future projects, I will spend more time on the first steps of the design process (research, user stories, user flows, and wireframes) before even considering the overall visual design. <span>The beginning of the journey will inform the later parts.</span> I think what’s key here is being patient and focusing on solving the core problems first and foremost.</p>
